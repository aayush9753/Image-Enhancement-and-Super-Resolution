Image capturing has been improved over the years, leading to increased usage in 
various applications for achieving a digital image. The images help keep a memory of the 
occasion and are also used to achieve an effective and useful means of capturing and 
studying the different phenomenon in a variety of fields. One of the challenging issues in 
image capturing is the utilization of limited and underpowered hardware in remote 
locations for capturing low-resolution images. The applications in such an environment are 
limited by the hardware, which results in low quality and low-resolution images that cannot 
be effectively used without improvements through image processing.
Due to increased research on this topic, there has been a considerable improvement in the 
imaging approach. Improving image quality can be achieved through the use of neural 
networks and deep learning techniques. In this project, we first enhanced the light levels of 
the images by using Low Light Convolutional Neural Network (LLCNN). After that, 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used for enhancing the image resolution and 
quality of the images.

The proposed method is a hybrid approach implemented through the effective use of 
the Low Light Convolutional Neural Networks (LLCNN), Super-Resolution Generative 
Adversarial Networks (SRGAN), and a custom CNN architecture to produce images with 
better lighting and resolution. After this processing, the images will be scaled 4x from 
corresponding low-resolution images, and an image with improved visual perception and 
fidelity is produced. The results are validated through extensive experimentation, which 
shows the method's effectiveness to improve images based on PSNR and SSIM scores.
